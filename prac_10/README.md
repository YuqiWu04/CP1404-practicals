# Practical 10
# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I'm usually not very accurate when evaluating my time, because sometimes some of the topics are more complicated, and sometimes I spend quite a bit of time analyzing as well as constructing them, 
which isn't very easy for me.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

For time management, I would firstly readjust my time assessment based on the previous time timings and then readjust it for the next time, 
and secondly I would improve my ability to write code based on the weekly PRACTICAL feedback, which would reduce the amount of time I spent writing code

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned from this assessment how to properly manage my time, 
as well as improve the speed at which I write code through each assignment experience.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I've learned how to better improve my code from the review of comments 
I've received from others who have been very careful to point out my shortcomings,
which has been very helpful in learning about my code, such as how to write comments better and how to optimize my layout

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned how to circumvent some of the irregularities in code expression from the reviews of others, who would point out to me what needed to be 
changed and optimized

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
practicals.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation
In this week's code, others have commented to me indicating that I need more code comments as well as optimized layoutsã€‚
These comments point out some deficiencies in my code and things related to comments

### Good Code Review 2

[prac8 link](https://github.com/YuqiWu04/CP1404-practicals/tree/master/prac_08)

### Explanation

Regarding the comments for week 8, my classmate's comment to me indicated that it would be better to include more comments as well as a docstring for the class

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Overall, for the whole exercise I need to follow the rules of the code including the SRP, not only that, 
for the whole course I need to be more familiar with the idea of writing code, secondly I need to improve my naming habits to avoid poor names, 
and lastly I need to check every mistake based on the feedback of each code so that I can prevent the same mistake in the next project.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I think I did a good job on my homework for weeks 3, 4, 6, and 9. This is because I have learned from the previous weeks' assignments to improve my code, 
and I have a very good grasp of what I have learned during these weeks
