# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've become more attentive and more familiar with handling code logic

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve my speed in writing code to complete projects, I am slow in dealing with some complex problems

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I've made simple comments on some complex code, so that the reader can better understand the meaning of my code.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

For the possibility of duplication in some of the code, I've realised that I'm going to improve my code to avoid unnecessary duplication

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think the course is pretty good now, but I'm not very proficient in terms of practice, I'd recommend being able to increase the amount of practice in the course to improve the ability to write code
