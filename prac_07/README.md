# Introduction about myself
My name is Yuqi.Wu, 20 year-old-boy, this is link my own github about [my code ](https://github.com/YuqiWu04/CP1404-practicals)


## Reflection about this lecture

* I have learned the SRP principle of code function from this course, which will help us to use this function better and write code more efficiently
* I also learned to use the class class to write oriented programming, which can better deal with large programming programs
* I learned how to correctly name variables, functions, and classes
* I learned about method types for storing elements like list， tuple， dictionary， and so on.
